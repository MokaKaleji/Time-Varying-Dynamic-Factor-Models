Parameters with Dynamic Factors, University of Bologna.

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of three advanced dynamic factor models designed to capture evolving structures in high-dimensional time series data. These models are particularly suited for macroeconomic or financial datasets where relationships among variables change over time.

The three models implemented are:

1. **DFTL** ‚Äì Dynamic Factor model with Time-varying Loadings
2. **DFTLTA** ‚Äì DFTL with Time-varying Transition Matrix (A)
3. **DFTLTATQ** ‚Äì DFTLTA extended with a Time-varying State Covariance Matrix (Q)

Each model includes two scripts: one for estimation and one for forecasting. This README provides detailed guidance on each model‚Äôs purpose, methodology, inputs, and execution.

## üîπ 1. DFTL: Dynamic Factor model with Time-varying Loadings

### Description

The DFTL model estimates latent factors from a high-dimensional dataset using a factor model where **factor loadings vary over time**. This allows the relationship between observed variables and latent factors to evolve smoothly, capturing gradual structural changes.

### Files

* `DFTL_estim.m` ‚Äì Estimates latent factors and time-varying loadings from input data.
* `DFTL_forecasting.m` ‚Äì Generates out-of-sample forecasts using estimated components.

### Methodology

* Extracts latent factors via PCA or weighted PCA.
* Applies kernel smoothing or local weighting to estimate time-varying factor loadings.
* Assumes static AR dynamics in the factor process.

### Inputs

* A data matrix `Y` (dimensions: T √ó N), where T is time and N is the number of variables.
* Optional: tuning parameters for kernel smoothing.

### Outputs

* Estimated latent factors (`Fhat`)
* Time-varying loadings (`Lhat(t)` for each t)
* Forecasts for user-specified horizons

### Usage

```matlab
% Estimate model
DFTL_estim;

% Forecast future observations
DFTL_forecasting;
```

## üîπ 2. DFTLTA: DFTL with Time-varying Transition Matrix (A)

### Description

DFTLTA builds on DFTL by introducing **time-varying autoregressive (AR) coefficients** in the latent factor evolution equation. This captures evolving persistence or regime shifts in factor dynamics, making forecasts more adaptive to recent trends.

### Files

* `DFTLTA_estim.m` ‚Äì Estimates factors, loadings, and time-varying AR coefficients.
* `DFTLTA_forecasting.m` ‚Äì Forecasts future observations using dynamic factors and AR processes.

### Methodology

* Uses locally weighted regression or kernel smoothing to estimate time-varying AR coefficients.
* Models factor evolution as: `F_t = A(t) * F_{t-1} + noise`
* Jointly estimates time-varying loadings and AR parameters.

### Inputs

* Same data matrix `Y` as in DFTL.
* Additional bandwidth parameters for smoothing AR terms.

### Outputs

* Estimated latent factors (`Fhat`)
* Time-varying loadings (`Lhat(t)`)
* Time-varying AR matrices (`Ahat(t)`)
* Forecasts for selected horizons

### Usage

```matlab
% Estimate dynamic model with time-varying AR
DFTLTA_estim;

% Forecast using AR-evolving factors
DFTLTA_forecasting;
```

## üîπ 3. DFTLTATQ: DFTLTA with Time-varying State Covariance Matrix (Q)

### Description

DFTLTATQ is the most comprehensive of the three models. It allows **both autoregressive dynamics and the state disturbance covariance matrix** to vary over time. This captures time-varying uncertainty and volatility in the latent factor process, especially useful in financial or crisis-prone environments.

### Files

* `DFTLTATQ_estim.m` ‚Äì Estimates the full time-varying system: loadings, AR, and Q matrices.
* `DFTLTATQ_forecasting.m` ‚Äì Forecasts using all time-varying components for robust prediction.

### Methodology

* Extends the state-space representation to allow Q(t) to change over time.
* Uses nonparametric or local-likelihood methods to estimate Q(t).
* Builds on the DFTLTA structure for AR and loading estimation.

### Inputs

* Same base data matrix `Y`.
* Additional smoothing bandwidths for Q(t).

### Outputs

* Latent factors (`Fhat`)
* Time-varying loadings (`Lhat(t)`)
* Time-varying AR matrices (`Ahat(t)`)
* Time-varying state noise covariance (`Qhat(t)`)
* Forecasts with uncertainty bands (optional)

### Usage

```matlab
% Estimate full dynamic factor model
DFTLTATQ_estim;

% Generate forecasts with evolving uncertainty
DFTLTATQ_forecasting;
```

## üì¶ Requirements

* MATLAB R2020a or newer
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for regression, smoothing, filtering)
* All files should be placed in the same working directory
* Input dataset must be preprocessed (e.g., stationary, cleaned for NAs)
