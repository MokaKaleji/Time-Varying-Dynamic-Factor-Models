%% QML Dynamic Factor Model With Time-varying Loadings, A, and Q
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Main Script for Quasi Maximum Likelihood Dynamic Factor Model with 
% Time-Varying Parameters
% Purpose:
% This script facilitates the estimation of a dynamic factor model with 
% time-varying loadings, transition matrices, and process noise covariances.
% It begins with dataset selection, allowing the user to choose between 
% monthly or quarterly data, specify the training sample size, and standardize
% the data. The processed data is then passed to the DFTLAQ function for 
% model estimation.
% Workflow:
%   1. Dataset selection and loading
%   2. Training sample size specification
%   3. Data standardization
%   4. Model estimation using DFTLAQ.m
% Dependencies:
%   - DFTLAQ.m
%   - lsfm.m
%   - MK_VAR.m
%   - MK_ols.m
%   - MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for listdlg, readtable)

%% Dataset Selection, Frequency, Training Sample Size, and Standardization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:
% Allow the user to select the dataset periodicity (monthly or quarterly), 
% load the corresponding data, specify the training sample size, and 
% standardize the data for numerical stability in model estimation.
% Explanation:
% The dynamic factor model requires a multivariate time series dataset. 
% This section provides a user-friendly interface to choose between 
% pre-processed monthly or quarterly datasets, ensuring flexibility in 
% periodicity. The training sample size (T_train) is specified to focus on
% a subset of the data, which is useful for in-sample estimation and 
% out-of-sample forecasting. Standardization (zero mean, unit variance) is
% applied to prevent numerical issues and ensure consistent scaling across 
% variables, a common practice in high-dimensional time series modeling.

% --- Present Available Periodicity Options and Capture User Choice ---
% Purpose: Display a dialog for the user to select dataset periodicity.
% Explanation: The listdlg function provides a graphical interface to choose
% between monthly ('MD1959.xlsx') and quarterly ('QD1959.xlsx') datasets. 
% The selection is validated to ensure a choice is made, halting execution 
% if cancelled to prevent undefined behavior.
options = {'Monthly (MD1959.xlsx)', 'Quarterly (QD1959.xlsx)'};
[choiceIndex, ok] = listdlg('PromptString','Select dataset:',...
                             'SelectionMode','single',...
                             'ListString',options,...
                             'Name','Dataset Selection',...
                             'ListSize',[400 200]);
if ~ok
    error('Dataset selection cancelled. Exiting script.');
end
% --- Load Data Based on Frequency ---
% Purpose: Load the selected dataset from an Excel file and extract the time
% series data.
% Explanation: The filepath is constructed based on the user's choice, 
% pointing to pre-processed datasets stored in a specific directory. The data
% is read into a table using readtable, then converted to a numeric array. 
% For quarterly data, the first column (date index) is excluded, as it is not
% part of the time series. The dimensions T (time points) and N (variables)
% are extracted for subsequent processing.
switch choiceIndex
    case 1                                                                 % Monthly frequency
        filepath = ['/Users/moka/Research/Thesis/Live Project/' ...
            'Processed_Data/MD1959.xlsx'];
        raw = readtable(filepath);
        x = table2array(raw);                                              % Include all series
        T = size(x,1);
    case 2                                                                 % Quarterly frequency
        filepath = ['/Users/moka/Research/Thesis/Live Project/' ...
            'Processed_Data/QD1959.xlsx'];
        raw = readtable(filepath);
        x = table2array(raw(:,2:end));                                     % Drop date index
        T = size(x,1);
    otherwise
        error('Unexpected selection index.');
end
[N_obs, N] = size(x);
% --- Define Training Sample Size ---
% Purpose: Prompt the user to specify the number of observations for the 
% training sample.
% Explanation: The training sample size (T_train) determines the subset of 
% data used for model estimation, allowing the remaining observations for 
% out-of-sample validation or forecasting. A default value of 225 is suggested,
% but the user can input any integer between 1 and T-1. The input is validated
% to ensure it is positive and less than the total number of observations, 
% preventing invalid training periods.
defaultTrain = '225';
prompt = sprintf(['Dataset has %d observations. Enter training size ' ...
    '(T_train):'], T);
userInput = inputdlg(prompt, 'Training Horizon', [3 100], {defaultTrain});
if isempty(userInput)
    error('No training size provided. Exiting.');
end
T_train = str2double(userInput{1});
assert(T_train>0 && T_train<T, 'T_train must be integer in (0, %d)', T);
% --- Standardization ---
% Purpose: Standardize the training data to zero mean and unit variance.
% Explanation: Standardization is critical for numerical stability in 
% high-dimensional factor models, as variables with different scales can lead
% to ill-conditioned matrices or biased factor estimates. The training data
% (first T_train observations) is centered by subtracting the mean and scaled
% by dividing by the standard deviation, computed across the training sample.
% This ensures all variables contribute equally to the factor structure and
% prevents numerical overflow in the EM algorithm.
x_train = x(1:T_train, :);
mean_train = mean(x_train);
std_train  = std(x_train);
x_train_norm = (x_train - mean_train) ./ std_train;

%% Model Estimation with DFTLAQ
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:
% Estimate the dynamic factor model using the standardized training data.
% Explanation:
% The QMLDFM_TVLAQ function is called with the standardized training data 
% x_train_norm, along with user-specified or default parameters for the 
% number of factors (R), bandwidths (h, h_A), VAR lag order (p), and EM 
% algorithm settings (max_iter, tol). The model estimates time-varying 
% loadings, factors, and covariances, producing outputs for analysis and 
% forecasting. Here, we set example parameters, but these can be adjusted
% based on the dataset or research objectives.

%% Setting Model Parameters & Running DFM with TVL&A&Q estimation 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% --- Set Model Parameters ---
% Explanation: Define parameters for QMLDFM_TVLAQ. These are illustrative 
% values and should be tuned based on the dataset's characteristics 
% (e.g., number of variables, time series dynamics). R=5 assumes a moderate
% number of factors; h=0.1 and h_A=0.1 balance smoothness and flexibility;
% p=2 allows for lagged dynamics; max_iter=1000 and tol=1e-6 ensure convergence.

  % --- Dimensions ---
  % Purpose: Extract dimensions.
  % Explanation: The input data X is a T x N matrix where T is the number
  % of time points and N is the number of observed variables. 
  [T, N] = size(X);

  % --- Default Bandwidth for Kernel Smoothing ---
  % Purpose: Set default bandwidth for time-varying parameter estimation 
  % if not provided.
  % Explanation: The bandwidth h_A controls the smoothness of Ahat and 
  % Qhat estimates.
  % A smaller h_A allows more time variation but may lead to overfitting;
  % a larger h_A smooths estimates, enhancing stability. Default is 0.1,
  % balancing flexibility and robustness.
  if nargin < 7
      h_A = 0.1;                                                           % Default bandwidth for Ahat and Qhat
  end

  % --- Initial Estimates via Locally Stationary Factor Model (LSFM) ---
  % Purpose: Obtain initial estimates of time-varying loadings, factors,
  % and idiosyncratic covariance using a kernel-based static factor model.
  % Explanation: The lsfm function applies kernel-weighted principal 
  % component analysis (PCA) to estimate Lambda_t (N x R), f_t (R x 1),
  % and Sigma_t (N x N) at each time t. This provides a starting point 
  % for the EM algorithm, leveraging local covariance structures to 
  % capture time-varying relationships. The bandwidth h controls the 
  % smoothness of these initial estimates.
  [~, Fhat_initial, Lhat, Sigmahat] = lsfm(X, R, h);
  Fhat = Fhat_initial;                                                     % T x R initial factors
  Lhat = permute(Lhat, [1, 2, 3]);                                         % Reshape to N x R x T for consistency
  % Initialize Sigma_e_hat as a diagonal matrix using the average 
  % idiosyncratic variance across time, ensuring positive definiteness 
  % and simplicity.
  Sigma_e_hat = diag(mean(diag(squeeze(mean(Sigmahat, 3)))) * ones(N, 1));

  % --- VAR(p) Initialization for Factor Dynamics ---
  % Purpose: Initialize the time-varying VAR(p) coefficients Ahat and 
  % process noise Qhat.
  % Explanation: The ML_VAR function estimates a time-invariant VAR(p) 
  % model on the initial factors Fhat_initial to obtain starting values 
  % for Ahat_t,i (R x R matrices for lags i=1,...,p). These are replicated
  % across all t to initialize Ahat. Qhat is initialized as the covariance
  % of factor differences, approximating the process noise variance.
  [~, ~, AL0] = MK_VAR(Fhat_initial, p, 0);                                % R x R x p initial VAR coefficients
  state_dim = R * p;                                                       % Dimension of companion state vector
  state_dim_aug = R * (p + 1);                                             % Augmented state dimension including current factors
  Ahat = cell(T, p);                                                       % T x p cell array for time-varying coefficients
  for t = 1:T
      for lag = 1:p
          Ahat{t, lag} = AL0(:, :, lag);                                   % Initialize Ahat as constant across time
      end
  end
  % Estimate initial Qhat from the covariance of factor differences
  Qhat_initial = cov(Fhat_initial(p+1:end, :) - Fhat_initial(p:end-1, :)); % R x R
  Qhat = repmat(Qhat_initial, [1, 1, T]);                                  % R x R x T, constant across time initially

  % --- Precompute Kernel Weights for Time-Varying Parameters ---
  % Purpose: Compute Gaussian kernel weights for smoothing Ahat and Qhat 
  % estimates.
  % Explanation: Time-varying parameters are estimated using 
  % kernel-weighted averages over time, with weights determined by a 
  % Gaussian kernel K((u_s - u_t)/h_A). Here, u_t = t/T normalizes time 
  % to [0,1], and h_A controls the smoothing window. Weights are normalized
  % to sum to 1 for each t, ensuring proper averaging.
  u = (1:T)' / T;                                                          % Normalized time index
  weights = cell(T, 1);                                                  
  for t = 1:T
      z = (u - u(t)) / h_A;                                                % Scaled time differences
      weights{t} = (1 / sqrt(2*pi)) * exp(-0.5 * z.^2);                    % Gaussian kernel
      weights{t} = weights{t} / sum(weights{t});                           % Normalize weights
  end

  % --- EM Algorithm ---
  % Purpose: Iteratively estimate latent states and model parameters 
  % using the EM algorithm.
  % Explanation: The EM algorithm alternates between the E-step 
  % (estimating latent states via Kalman filtering/smoothing) and the 
  % M-step (updating parameters Lambda_t, Ahat_t, Qhat_t, and Sigma_e_hat).
  % Convergence is assessed by the relative change in log-likelihood.
  logL_prev = -Inf;                                                        % Initialize previous log-likelihood
  for iter = 1:max_iter
  % ### E-Step: Kalman Filter and Smoother ###
  % Purpose: Estimate latent states and their covariances given 
  % current parameters.
  % Explanation: The Kalman filter computes filtered states (f_{t|t})
  % and covariances (P_{t|t}) forward in time, while the smoother refines
  % these to smoothed states (f_{t|T}) and covariances (P_{t|T}) using all
  % observations. The log-likelihood is accumulated for convergence checking.
  logL = 0;                                                                % Initialize log-likelihood for this iteration
  xitT = zeros(T, state_dim_aug);                                          % T x (R*(p+1)) smoothed states
  Fhat_filt_aug = zeros(T, state_dim_aug);                                 % Filtered augmented states
  P_filt_aug = zeros(state_dim_aug, state_dim_aug, T);                     % Filtered covariances
  Fhat_pred_aug = zeros(T, state_dim_aug);                                 % Predicted states
  P_pred_aug = zeros(state_dim_aug, state_dim_aug, T);                     % Predicted covariances
  Fhat_smooth_aug = zeros(T, state_dim_aug);                               % Temporary smoothed states
  P_smooth_aug = zeros(state_dim_aug, state_dim_aug, T);                   % Smoothed covariances

  % --- Initial State for Kalman Filter ---
  % Purpose: Initialize the state and covariance at t=1 with a diffuse prior.
  % Explanation: The initial state is set using the first p+1 factor 
  % estimates from LSFM, arranged in the augmented state vector 
  % [f_t; f_{t-1}; ...; f_{t-p}]. A large diagonal covariance (I) 
  % reflects high initial uncertainty, ensuring robustness to 
  % misspecification of initial conditions.
  for pp = 1:p+1
          if pp <= T
              Fhat_filt_aug(1, (pp-1)*R+1:pp*R) = Fhat_initial(pp, :);
          end
  end
  P_filt_aug(:, :, 1) = eye(state_dim_aug);                                % Diffuse prior covariance


  % --- Kalman Filter (Forward Pass) ---
  % Purpose: Compute filtered states and covariances forward in time.
  % Explanation: The Kalman filter alternates between prediction 
  % (using the state transition model) and update (incorporating observations).
  % The state vector is augmented to include lagged factors, and the transition
  % matrix A_aug_t is time-varying. The log-likelihood is computed for t > p
  % to avoid issues with initial lags.
  for t = 1:T
          % Construct time-varying augmented transition matrix
          % Explanation: A_aug_t is an (R*(p+1)) x (R*(p+1)) matrix in 
          % companion form, where the first R rows contain Ahat_t,i for 
          % lags i=1,...,p, and subdiagonal blocks are identity matrices
          % to shift lagged states.
          A_aug_t = zeros(state_dim_aug, state_dim_aug);
          for lag = 1:p
              A_aug_t(1:R, (lag-1)*R + 1 : lag*R) = Ahat{t, lag};
          end
          for i = 1:p
              A_aug_t(R*i+1:R*(i+1), R*(i-1)+1:R*i) = eye(R);
          end

          % Time-varying process noise covariance
          % Explanation: Q_aug is an (R*(p+1)) x (R*(p+1)) matrix with 
          % Qhat_t in the top-left R x R block, representing noise for 
          % current factors, and zeros elsewhere.
          Q_aug = zeros(state_dim_aug, state_dim_aug);
          Q_aug(1:R, 1:R) = Qhat(:, :, t);

          % Prediction Step
          % Explanation: Predict the state and covariance at t given t-1:
          %   f_{t|t-1} = A_t * f_{t-1|t-1}
          %   P_{t|t-1} = A_t * P_{t-1|t-1} * A_t' + Q_t
          % For t=1, use the initial state and covariance.
          if t > 1
              Fhat_pred_aug(t, :) = A_aug_t * Fhat_filt_aug(t-1, :)';
              P_pred_aug(:, :, t) = A_aug_t * P_filt_aug(:, :, t-1) * ...
                  A_aug_t' + Q_aug;
          else
              Fhat_pred_aug(t, :) = Fhat_filt_aug(t, :);
              P_pred_aug(:, :, t) = P_filt_aug(:, :, t);
          end

% Purpose:
% Estimates a static factor model at each time point using 
% kernel-weighted PCA to provide initial estimates of time-varying loadings
% (Lambda_t), factors (f_t), and idiosyncratic covariance (Sigma_t).
% Reference:

function [CChat, Fhat, Lhat, Sigmahat] = lsfm(X, R, h)
% Mathematical Formulation:
% For each t, compute a local covariance matrix:
% Sigma_t = sum(w_{t,s} * X_s * X_s'),  w_{t,s} = K((u_s - u_t)/h) / sum(K)
% where K is a Gaussian kernel, u_t = t/T, and h is the bandwidth. 
% Loadings Lambda_t are the top R eigenvectors of Sigma_t, and factors 
% are f_t = (Lambda_t' * Lambda_t)^{-1} * Lambda_t' * X_t.
% Inputs:
%   X: T x N data matrix
%   R: Number of factors
%   h: Bandwidth for kernel smoothing
% Outputs:

% Inputs:
%   y: T x R time series matrix
%   k: Number of lags
%   det: Deterministic terms (0: none, 1: constant, 2: trend, 3: both)
% Outputs:
%   A: Coefficient matrix (including deterministic terms)
%   u: T-k x R residuals
